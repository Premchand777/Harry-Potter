<h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h2>

<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher's_Stone_Book_Cover 1.jpg" alt="Harry Potter 1" width="210" height="auto"></p>

<p>When Harry was just one year old, his parents, James and Lily, were murdered by the most powerful Dark Wizard, Lord Voldemort (subsequently called "You-Know-Who" and "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" by those too superstitious to use his actual name). He attempted to kill Harry too, but was unsuccessful and only left a lightning bolt shaped scar on Harry's forehead. Voldemort's body was destroyed, but his soul was not. Harry later learns that the reason why he survived was because his mother sacrificed herself for him, and her love was something that Voldemort could not destroy.<br>

<h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>


<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets 2.jpg" alt="Harry Potter 2" width="210" height="auto"></p>

<p>In the second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Rowling pits Harry against Tom Riddle, Lord Voldemort's "memory" within a secret diary which has possessed Ron's younger sister Ginny. When Muggle-born students are suddenly being Petrified, many suspect that Harry may be behind the attacks, further alienating him from his peers.<br>

<h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>

<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban 3.jpg" alt="Harry Potter 3" width="210" height="auto"></p>
<p>In the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Rowling uses a time travel premise. Harry learns that his parents were betrayed to Voldemort by their friend Peter Pettigrew, who framed Harry's godfather Sirius Black for the crimes, condemning him to Azkaban, the wizard prison.<br>

<h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_cover 4.png" alt="Harry Potter 4" width="210" height="auto"></p>

<p>In the previous books, Harry is written as a child, but Rowling states that in the fourth novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, "Harry's horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older."[10] Harry's developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes romantically interested in Cho Chang, a student in Ravenclaw house. Tension mounts, however, when Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, even though another Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory, has already been selected. Voldemort uses the Tournament for an elaborate scheme to lure Harry into a deadly trap.

<h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h2>

<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix 5.jpg" alt="Harry Potter 5" width="210" height="auto"></p>

<p>In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. Harry is made to look like an attention-seeking liar, and Dumbledore a trouble-maker.

<h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>

<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_cover 6.png" alt="Harry Potter 6" width="210" height="auto"></p>
<p>In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that, Rowling says, is based on her and her younger sister's own difficult teenage years.[14] Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harry's personal life: "Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following, he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had.

<h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h2>

<p><img src="Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows 7.jpg" alt="Harry Potter 7" width="210" height="auto"></p>

<p>In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to complete Dumbledore's task: to search for and destroy Voldemort's remaining four Horcruxes, then find and kill the Dark Lord. The three pit themselves against Voldemort's newly formed totalitarian police state, an action that tests Harry's courage and moral character. Voldemort's seizure of the Ministry of Magic leads to discriminatory and genocidal policies against Muggle-borns, fuelled by propaganda and fear.
